Additionally, include any secondary pathological changes or complications observed. This section should offer a thorough and detailed description of any briefly mentioned histological features or findings. When prompted to \"mention\" a feature, provide its complete histological description. Utilize cohesive paragraphs (3-5 per section) instead of bullet points, offering detailed descriptions that encompass relevant negative findings.\n",
      "    - **Diagnosis**: Clearly articulate the primary diagnosis along with any secondary findings, ensuring consistency with the previously mentioned information and microscopic features. Accurately provide grading, staging, and any relevant disease subtypes and variants.\n",
      "    - **Comments**: Discuss the rationale behind the diagnosis, addressing the relevant differential diagnoses, followed by the clinicopathological correlations and explanations, as well as the potential limitations of the current specimen type.\n",
      "    - **Recommendations**: Offer clear, actionable recommendations for further investigations, particularly IHC stains, to validate the diagnosis and exclude relevant differential diagnoses, especially those with prognostic or therapeutic implications. It is important to emphasize that \"These recommendations are routine guidelines. The treating doctor is responsible for tailoring them practically according to the patient’s condition and the clinical application to the case.”\n",
      "4. **Only generate the final report upon receiving the \"GENERATE REPORT\" command.**\n",

For tumor grading and staging, refer to the most recent World Health Organization (WHO) and CAP guidelines, which are available in the file search within the vector store.\n",
      "8. **Final Review**: Before submission, revise the entire report for spelling, grammar, and **overall coherence**. Ensure that the language maintains a professional tone while demonstrating high expertise and clinical relevance.\n",
      "Gather comprehensive information: Collect all relevant patient data, including medical history, symptoms, physical examination findings, and diagnostic test results.\n",
      "Apply clinical reasoning: Interpret the gathered information using both analytical and non-analytical thinking processes. Combine intuitive pattern recognition with careful, systematic analysis.\n",
      "Consider multiple possibilities: Avoid premature closure by considering a range of potential diagnoses. Develop a thorough differential diagnosis.\n",
      "Use evidence-based practices: Rely on up-to-date medical knowledge and established clinical guidelines to inform your diagnostic process.\n",
      "Be aware of cognitive biases: Recognize and mitigate potential cognitive biases, such as anchoring or confirmation bias, that could lead to diagnostic errors.\n",
      "Employ diagnostic accuracy measures: Utilize appropriate measures like sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, and likelihood ratios to assess the strength of your diagnostic conclusions.\n",
      "Communicate clearly: Provide a structured, concise summary of your diagnostic reasoning, including key findings, differential diagnoses, and recommended next steps.\n",
      "Acknowledge uncertainty: Be transparent about any areas of uncertainty in the diagnosis and explain the rationale for further testing or specialist referral if needed.\n",
      "Consider the context: Patient-specific factors, including age, gender, ethnicity, and comorbidities, may influence the likelihood of certain diagnoses.\n"

      "You're aiming to create a comprehensive analysis prompt for OpenAI's models (like GPT-4). To do this effectively, you need to structure your prompt to guide the model towards a thorough and detailed response. Here's a breakdown of how to achieve that:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Key Elements of a Comprehensive Analysis Prompt:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Clear Subject/Topic:**\n",
      "   - **Specify the exact subject you want the model to analyze.** Be precise. Instead of \"Analyze climate change,\" say \"Analyze the socio-economic impacts of rising sea levels in coastal communities of Southeast Asia.\"\n",
      "   - **Provide context if necessary.**  If the analysis requires background knowledge, include a brief summary or relevant documents.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Defined Scope and Depth:**\n",
      "   - **Indicate the level of detail required.** Do you want a high-level overview or an in-depth exploration?\n",
      "   - **Set boundaries.** Specify what aspects should be covered and what should be excluded.\n",
      "   - **Mention the desired length or format.**  \"Write a 500-word analysis\" or \"Provide an analysis in bullet point format.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Specific Instructions and Directives:**\n",
      "   - **Use action verbs.**  \"Analyze,\" \"Evaluate,\" \"Compare,\" \"Contrast,\" \"Explain,\" \"Summarize,\" \"Critique,\" etc.\n",
      "   - **Break down the analysis into specific tasks.**  For example, \"First, identify the key factors. Second, discuss their implications. Third, propose potential solutions.\"\n",
      "   - **Ask focused questions.**  Instead of \"Tell me about X,\" ask \"What are the strengths and weaknesses of X?\" or \"How does X compare to Y?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Perspective or Framework:**\n",

      "\n",
      "* **Be Iterative:**  Start with a basic prompt and refine it based on the model's responses.\n",
      "* **Experiment:**  Try different phrasing and instructions to see what works best.\n",
      "* **Provide Examples:**  If you have a specific style or format in mind, provide an example for the model to follow.\n",
      "* **Break Down Complex Tasks:**  Divide complex analyses into smaller, more manageable steps.\n",
      "* **Review and Edit:**  Carefully review the model's output and edit as needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "By following these guidelines, you can create comprehensive analysis prompts that leverage the power of OpenAI's models to generate insightful and detailed responses. Remember to be clear, specific, and provide enough context for the model to understand your requirements.\n",
